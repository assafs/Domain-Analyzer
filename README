Domain Analyzer tries to detect malicious domain by the following methods:

1. Consult constantly updated Black ASN (Autonomous system) numbers
2. Try to connect to the domain address and examine the body response (can be customized by changing the ACL file)
3. consult known (good) domains
4. detect FLUX domains
