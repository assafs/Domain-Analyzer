Domain Analyzer tries to detect malicious domains using the following methods:

1. Check the constantly updated Black ASN (Autonomous system numbers)
2. Try to connect to the domain address and examine the HTTP body response, blacklisting default web-server pages
(can be customized by changing the ACL file)
3. Check the domain against Alexa's monthly updated top 1M known (good) domains
4. Detection of Fast-FLUX domains using Maxmind's GeoIP library
